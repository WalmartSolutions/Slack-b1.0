# Why?
LiquidBounce skid that is claimed to be custom. There was nothing that I really had to change in the client since the Auth wasn't even referenced ðŸ˜­ (Paid client and Auth disconnected ðŸ”¥). Also the client usess ZKM 15 crack so I added a Semi deobfed version too ðŸ”¥.

# How To Use
1. "Download ZIP" using the "Code" button
